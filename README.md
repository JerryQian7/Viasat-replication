# Data Science Senior Capstone - Viasat VPN Analysis

## Purpose

Our goal is to predict whether a user is streaming video on a VPN by analyzing their network traffic traits such as video signatures, interpacket intervals, packet size, etc. through a machine learning classifier, then repeat the analysis with other noise present on the network.

Our data collection process uses the network-stats script from Viasat, which will output packet data on a per-second, per-connection basis from any given network interface. This tool was designed to focus more on connection-to-connection data rather than individual packet data. Once running, network-stats will output the time, source, destination, and protocol of the packets sent within any connection, as well as the count, size, time, and direction of each packetâ€™s arrival at the destination.
